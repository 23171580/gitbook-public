## Deep Thought

A place for me to reflect on my thoughts, and hopefully learn from others as well.

## Timestamps

I use timestamps a lot to journal, write notes or reports. It helps me organize my document, and to help me keep track of time.

## WhatsApp

I sometimes have to message people on WhatsApp, but I don't necessarily want to add their contact to my address book.

You can use a WhatsApp "API" to open up message to a phone number, without having it in your phone book
