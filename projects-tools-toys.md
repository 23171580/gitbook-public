## Tools

### Timestamps

I use timestamps a lot to journal, write notes or reports. It helps me organize my documents and thoughts, and to help me keep track of time.

### WhatsApp

I occasionally have to message stranger on WhatsApp, but I don't necessarily want to add their contact to my address book.

You can use a WhatsApp "API" to open up message to a phone number, without having it in your phone book.
