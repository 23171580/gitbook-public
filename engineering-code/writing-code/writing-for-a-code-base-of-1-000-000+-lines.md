# Writing for a code base of 1,000,000+ Lines

Writing code for a 1,000 line application is very different from writing for 1,000,000 line application.

When the codebase becomes so large, you simply cannot remember everything.

You rely on naming, conventions, and trust.

### Conventions

Understand the conventions already used, and stick to them. It makes it easier to read the code, and get it reviewed.

In a large code base, coding conventions may be different from team to team.

### Consistency

Use linters.

### Don't waste time discussing style

Use linters.

If a discussion about style comes up, quickly agree on something, and implement it in your linter.

### Trust in the code base

You will always be using a library written by someone else. You have to trust that it says it does what it does. If it doesn't, then you have to dive deeper down the rabbit hole.
