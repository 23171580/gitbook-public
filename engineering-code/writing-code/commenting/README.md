# Commenting

Comments increase cognitive load. Comments are a form of technical debt.

There can be both good and bad comments.

Comment on the "why" things work the way they are.

Good comments:

* Legal/regulatory explanations on why it does what it does

Leave links to other resources:

* Wikis
* GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
* Documentation

If comments are long and are not critical to be in the code, create a linkable resource, and use the link instead.

Dangers of bad comments:

* Comments can be outdated and wrong
