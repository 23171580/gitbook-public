# Scripts

When writing scripts, always leave a file header about what the script does, or link to a proper resource.

Add context on:

* How this script is used
* Why this script is needed
* How to run this script

Generally standalone scripts may leave out a lot of context.

Example of a decent script:

```bash
!/bin/sh
# Reencrypts the keys in our database.
# This is necessary because ....
# http://www.example.com/wiki/details
```
