# Bad Practices

This is a list of things I look out for in a codebase.

## Bad Practices

General list of bad practices. You may see the points duplicated else where.

* Not being consistent
* Not paying attention to commit history
* Not isolating work into separate commits
* Not following style guides
* Committing commented code
* Long functions
* Spaghetti code
* Bad naming
* Magic constants
* Skipping pre commit hooks
* Skipping already existing tests without good reasons

## Code smells

* A lot of conditions \("if" statements, or "switch" statements\)
  * Logic is not properly structured
  * Should consider a factory
  * See [Be careful of enum in switch statements](becareful-of-enum-in-switch-statements.md)
* A lot of hacks
