# Technical Due Diligence

When conduction a Technical Due Diligence \(DD\), the question I am trying to answer is:

> What are the deal breakers in this investment?

To answer this, I need to identify:

* What does the investor consider a dealbreaker?
  * What are potential dealbreakers they may not even realize?
  * What is an investors investment thesis?
* What are the potential dealbreakers in this company?

When I am connected with a potential company, I provide a timeline.

* 30 Minutes max
* Introductions
* Explain the Technical Due Diligence process
* Learn a bit more about the company
* Explain any documentation that is required to fill
