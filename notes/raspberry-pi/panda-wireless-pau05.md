## Importing to Malaysia

I bought the PAU05 on Amazon shipping to Malaysia. I was required to pay SIRIM a RM100 deposit. The logistics company emailed me that I have to contact SIRIM \(you can do that via an email\). SIRIM requested information about the product I purchased, and then emailed me 3 forms I can either email them back, or deliver in person. I decided to deliver in person because the forms were quite confusing.
