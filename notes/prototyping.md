# Prototyping

## Questions to ask when Prototyping

* What are the limitations?
* When should I use it?
* When should I not use it?
* How much will it cost?

### Datastores

* How is the data model?
* How is the data accessed?
* How easy is it to export the data?
* How easy is it to import the data?

## What I want to play around with:

* AWS
  * AppSync
    * How does the GraphQL map to DynamoDB?
  * DynamoDB
    * How does it compare to GCP Firestore?
* Apollo \(GraphQL Server\)
  * How does it compare with Facebook's graphql-js implementation?
* GCP
  * How does it compare with AWS?
    * What is better?
    * What is worse?
  * Firebase
    * When, where should I use it?
  * Firestore
    * How does it compare to AWS DynamoDB?
  * Cloud functions
    * Testing async/await
    * Hosting a GraphQL instance on it

### Toys I want to build

* Note Taking App
  * With tags/taxonomies
  * Editing interface similar to GitBook WYSIWYG
