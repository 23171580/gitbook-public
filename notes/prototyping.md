# Prototyping

### Benefits of Prototyping:

* Quick evaluation
* Quick iteration
* Can build breadth of skills

### Cons of Prototyping:

* Can't build deep skills
  * Can narrow what you are prototyping to build deep skills

## Questions to ask when Prototyping

* What are the limitations?
* When should I use it?
* When should I not use it?
* How much will it cost?
* How small can I start?
* How can I make an MVP?
* How can I make it lean?

### Datastores

* How is the data model?
* How is the data accessed?
* How easy is it to export the data?
* How easy is it to import the data?

### Web App

* Prototype frontend with create-react-app

### Requires

* Document learning to prototype faster

## What I want to play around with:

* AWS
  * AppSync
    * How does the GraphQL map to DynamoDB?
  * DynamoDB
    * How does it compare to GCP Firestore?
* Apollo \(GraphQL Server\)
  * How does it compare with Facebook's graphql-js implementation?
* GCP
  * How does it compare with AWS?
    * What is better?
    * What is worse?
  * Firebase
    * When, where should I use it?
  * Firestore
    * How does it compare to AWS DynamoDB?
  * Cloud functions
    * Testing async/await
    * Hosting a GraphQL instance on it

### Toys I want to build

* Slido clone

### Logistics

Considerations \(for pickup and delivery\):

* number of vehicles/manpower
* time
* location
* weather
* difficulty , for example
  * front door vs
  * apartment vs
  * office unit

Algorithms/keywords

* Traveling salesman
* Vehicle routing problem
* Fleet management
* Route optimization
