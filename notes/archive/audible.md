I love audiobooks narrated by their authors, it feels like you are in the room with them. I mostly listen to them when I drive, so it feels like I'm in the car with them.

## Trevor Noah's Born a Crime

* [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/Born-a-Crime-Audiobook/B01IW9TQPK?qid=1553014383&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=DHC5SCDZGG3956J593WZ&)

My number one audiobook. Read by Trevor Noah himself. If you had to listen to anything, listen to this. Hear about how Trevor Noah had to hustle in South Africa. I learned so much about South Africa and how bad apartheid was. Some great laughs, and even better when Trevor Noah brings out his mastery of accents.

## Tony Hsieh's Delivering Happiness

* [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/Delivering-Happiness-Audiobook/B003O5FNTG?qid=1553014506&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=HTH4X73H5SXQM4D85H4V&)

## Chris Hadifeld's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth

## Phil Knights' Shoedog

Phil Knight is the founder of Nike. Unfortunately not spoken by Phil Knight himself, but a great book nonetheless. Because Nike was founded in 1964 you can really hear different business was back then.
