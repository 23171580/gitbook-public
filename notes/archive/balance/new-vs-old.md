# New vs Old

## New

Doing something new

* Requires being in a state of mind for openness
* Requires mental capacity to explore new things
* Requires being mindful
* Requires patience, can be frustrating with a different and new set of expectations
* Staying at the edge of new requires perseverance, discipline, and faith
  * No guidance at the edge of new
  * No documentation
  * No other experience to learn from
  * No guides, no mentors
  * Uncharted territory
    * Exploring uncharted territories is itself a skill
* Staying at the edge of everything new can thin you out

#### Pros:

* Provides variety
* Potentially high reward \(at the cons of high risk\)

* High risk \(at the pros of a potentially high reward\)

## Old

Doing something old
