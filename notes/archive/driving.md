  * Even if there are no cars there, it is a good habit to use them.
  * Be intentional about your direction.

  Never cruise in the fast lane \(right most lane\).

  * If you are planning to cruise, do it in the middle lane.

* Never change direction in the last second
  * This can cause an accident
  * If you are going to possibly miss a turn, just miss it instead of quickly serving to try to make your turn

Scenario:

* If you need to make an immediate left after a right turn, stay on the left side \(outside turn\).
