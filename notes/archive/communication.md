# Communication

Different dimensions

* Synchronous vs Asynchronous
* Private \(1 to 1\) vs Group \(1 to many\)

| Group \(1 to many\) | Synchronous and Group | Asynchronous and Group |

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

### Synchronous

Can be active or passive.

Can only provide for a single thread of communication.

#### Active

Direct communication with someone.

May include voice and video calls.

Examples:

* Being in an engaged conversation with someone.

#### Passive

Can provide a passive form of intimacy and connection. Can be describe as "non verbal intimacy".

Does not require active effort of energy or attention.

Requires just the physical presence of the other person around, and being in the same room or nearby, and doing their own thing.

Examples:

* Being in a nearby space as someone else.

### Asynchronous

Not in person.

Requires more active effort. There is no "Asynchronous Passive" communication similar to the "Synchronous Passive". All Asynchronous communication is active. If you are a lurker you are non contributing. This is ok if there are no expectations of contribution.

Allows you to edit your words before sending it.

Can be better for long form.

Can provide multiple threads of conversation.

Can be used to return to "past conversations".

#### Non Written

Examples:

* Speaker to a large audience \(Group, or Conference\)

#### Written or Recorded Form

* Doesnâ€™t allow for immediate questions or feedback.
* Easier to distribute \(copy, paste, forward\).
* Easier for computers to parse.
* Easier to dissect.
* May not contain tone, so may require being more explicit with providing context.
  * May make it easier to misinterpret.

Examples:

* Email
* Messages
* Social Media
* Tasks

## Private \(1 to 1\) vs Group \(1 to many\)

### Private \(1 to 1\)

Can be more personal.

### Group \(1 to many\)

Have to cater to the interests of the group.

## Combinations

### Synchronous and Private \(1 to 1\)

### Synchronous and Group \(1 to many\)

### Asynchronous and Private \(1 to 1\)

Contribution from both parties is most likely expected.

### Asynchronous and Group \(1 to many\)

Minor contribution from the group is expected.
