## Films, Movies, TV Series, etc

### Altered Carbon

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097140?s=i&trkid=13752289)
* [Deep Thought](https://www.deepthoughtapp.com/packages/altered-carbon-174/)

Scifi, Dystopian Future, San Francisco. Great intersection for me. Asks lots of great questions. Reminds me a lot of Ghost in the Shell.

* What if we could change bodies?

### Arrival

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117799)

Ok movie, was excited about it. I like the premise of space, and aliens. Reminds me a lot of Interstellar. Nice chill sunday evening movie.

### Cloud With a Chance of Meatballs

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70113007)

Amazing writing. I love the colors and the world building.

### Cowboy Bebop

Loved this series. As a teen, I wanted to be Spike Spiegel and fly through space. He was so cool

### Fight Club

* [Deep Thought](https://www.deepthoughtapp.com/packages/fight-club-112/)

Really love this film. Part of it speaks to me. It's great when you feel angry about the world

> Tyler Durden: The things you own end up owning you.

> Tyler Durden: It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.

> Tyler Durden: You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.

### Ghost in the Shell

The original animated movie, in Japanese with English subs. Really makes you think about what the future of humanity can be like.

Breath taking for its time.

Also worth watching is the anime series, "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"

The 2017 Scarlett Johansson version was more of an action film and didn't really ask any philosophical questions about the future of humanity.

### Hidden Figures

Decent Film, was interesting to learn about how Black Women contributed to Nasa. 

### The Incredibles

One of my favorite Pixar films. Great writing.

### Inception

I have this problem all the time. Dreams within dreams within dreams. What is there to not understand?

### Inside Man

A great heist film. I loved the ending.

### Interstellar

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70131314)

Good film, bit long. Good to pass the time on a quiet sunday afternoon.

### Gone Girl

Another great David Fincher film.

### The Lego Movie

* [Deep Thought](https://www.deepthoughtapp.com/packages/the-lego-movie-111/)

This movie speaks to the child in me, and has so many life lessons. I love the amount of detail in this movie, and how Lego pieces were used for everything.

The sequel was good, but as good as sequels can get.

> President Business: Hey, not so special anymore, huh? Well, guess what? No one ever told me I was special. I never got a trophy just for showing up! I'm not some special little snowflake, no! But as unspecial as I am, you are a thousand billion times more unspecial than me!  
> Emmet: You don't have to be the bad guy. You are the most talented, most interesting, and most extraordinary person in the universe. And you are capable of amazing things. Because you are the Special. And so am I. And so is everyone. The prophecy is made up, but it's also true. It's about all of us. Right now, it's about you. And you still can change everything.

### Love, Death and Robots

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608)
* [Deep Thought](https://www.deepthoughtapp.com/packages/love-death-robots-384/)

Was taken surprise by this. A great intersection about all the things I love.

From my [Facebook Post](https://www.facebook.com/aizatto/posts/10156698926130412):

> This series speaks to me. I didn't see it coming, and it looks like it just launched on Netflix.
>
> An 18 episode animated series, all with different styles and stories. Dystopian scifi, with episodes between 6 to 18 minutes long. Some humor, some mature content.
>
> If you have my tastes, you may enjoy it too. Am pleasantly surprised.

### Phone Booth

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/60024926)

Great film. The whole movie is filmed around a phone booth.

### The Social Network

I'm definitely biased because I used to work at Facebook, but still a great film nonetheless.

### Source Code

Great surprise at the end.
