# Gaming Tablet

I like my Nintendo Switch for its form factor, and making gaming more "casual", but it doesn't have all the games I want to play.

* Form factor of Nintendo Switch \(with controllers by the side\)
* Plays Windows/Steam games
* I want to "Pick up and Play"
* Play from the coach/bed
* Quick success or failure
  * Some sort of satisfaction within 15 minutes that makes me feel like I have progress, or am progressing

Options:

* [GPD WIN 2](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-2-handheld-game-console-for-aaa-games--2#/)
