# Gaming Tablet

I like my Nintendo Switch for its form factor, and making gaming more "casual", but it doesn't have all the games I want to play.

* Form factor of Nintendo Switch \(with controllers by the side\)
* Plays Windows/Steam games
* I want to "Pick up and Play"
* Play from the coach/bed

Options:

* [GPD WIN 2](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-2-handheld-game-console-for-aaa-games--2#/)
  * Pros:
    * Full Windows Support
* Android Tablet, with Shell for JoyCons
* VNC into a Windows PC
* [Shadow](https://shadow.tech/int)
  * Cons:
    * No support in Malaysia
    * No official iOS App, they have a Beta though
* [Stadia](https://stadia.dev/)
  * [https://stadia.dev/](https://stadia.dev/)

Games I want to play:

* Old school games, emulator
