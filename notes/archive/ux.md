# UX

## UX I hate:

* Over use of Modal dialogs
  * Some Modal dialogs should be pages
  * Some Modal dialogs should rewrite browser url to a page that can load it
  * Modal dialogs are great for small interstitials, not whole pages
* URLs that don't return back to a useful page
* Making websites that don't fit in a resolution of width of`960x600`
  * This is the resolution of half my laptop screen \(`1920x1200`\)
  * Worse is if you don't make it fit within width of `1280x720`
  * [https://github.com/aizatto/character-length](https://github.com/aizatto/character-length)
* Apps that restrict you to a particular country, with no good reason
  * For example, I am on the US Apple App Store, but I can't download the Starbucks Malaysia App.
  * Region Locking
