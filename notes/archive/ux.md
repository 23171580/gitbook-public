# UX

## UX I like:

* Keyboard shortcuts.
  * Plus points if it follows vim scrolling
  * Plus points if it reuses familiar shortcuts

## UX I hate:

* Over use of Modal dialogs
  * Some Modal dialogs should be pages
  * Some Modal dialogs should rewrite browser url to a page that can load it
  * Modal dialogs are great for small interstitials, not whole pages
  * Don't block my screen with a modal dialog asking me to subscribe
* URLs that don't return back to a useful page
* Making websites that don't fit in a resolution of width of`960x600`
  * This is the resolution of half my laptop screen \(`1920x1200`\)
  * Worse is if you don't make it fit within width of `1280x720`
  * [https://github.com/aizatto/character-length](https://github.com/aizatto/character-length)
* Clickbait
* Don't ask me to download your mobile app
* When asking people to enter something difficult \(ie, short urls\) and not using base58
  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58)
* Preventing me from using the back/forward button
* Stupid password limits
* Making it difficult to unsubscribe

#### Phone Notifications

Don't spam my phone with marketing notifications.  I know you can't get my attention via email spam, so don't spam me unless I ask for it.

#### Region Locking

Apps that restrict you to a particular country, with no good reason

For example, I am on the US Apple App Store, but I can't download the Starbucks Malaysia App.

Malaysia Culprits:

* [Starbucks](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/starbucks-malaysia/id888509698?mt=8) \(Both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/starbucks-malaysia/id888509698?mt=8) and Android\)
  * I don't understand why they can't use the US App itself
* [Speedrent](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/speedrent-property-rental/id998232868?mt=8)
* [Uniqlo](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id867492228?pt=80202&ct=website_appinstall_page&mt=8)
