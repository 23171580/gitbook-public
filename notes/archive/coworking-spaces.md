# Coworking Spaces

Why I wouldnâ€™t pay as a single individual:

* Primary concerns are as a single individual
* I would only spend a 1-2 hours there a day
  * I could potentially go to a coffee shop instead
* I like physically moving around

When I would pay:

* Central location for a team to come together for a few hours at a time
