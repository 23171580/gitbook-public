> Q28. Can I use **Panic!** or **Cat Balou** on cards in play?  
> A. Of course yes. You can play the Cat Balou on a card in an opponent’s hand \(randomly choosing which card to pick\) or on any one card in play, at your choice. The same for Panic!, with the following differences: you can target only cards of a player at distance 1, and the card you choose goes in your hand even if it was already in play. When that card is in your hand, you can play it as any other card.

#### Dynamite

Also see: Jail

> Players keep passing the Dynamite around until it explodes with the effect explained above, or it is draw or discarded by a Panic! or Cat Balou! If you have both the Dynamite and a Jail in play, check the Dynamite first. If you are damaged \(or even eliminated!\) by a Dynamite, this damage is not considered to be caused by any player.

#### Gatling

> It is not considered a BANG! card

#### Jail

> Jail cannot be played on the Sheriff
>
> If you have both the Dynamite and a Jail in play, check the Dynamite first.

#### Panic! _Panico!_

Also see: Cat Balou

> The symbols state: "Draw a card" from "a player at distance 1". Remember that this distance is not modified by weapons, but only by cards such as Mustang and/or scope.

Can be used to **take any card** in play. Dynamite, Jail, Barrel.

Cards go into your hand, and you can play it as any other card.

### Green-bordered Cards

> These cards are played in front of you, face up, like the blue bordered cards. To use an effect you must take the card from in front of you and discard it. How ever you cannot use the green bordered cards on the same turn in which you have played them.

> Only the cards with a Missed! symbol can be used out of turn

> Green bordered cards in front of the players are also defined to be "in play" and can be removed through the play of a Cat Balou, Panic!, Can Can, etc, just like the blue-bordered cards
