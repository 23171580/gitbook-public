> Q28. Can I use **Panic!** or **Cat Balou** on cards in play?  
> A. Of course yes. You can play the Cat Balou on a card in an opponent’s hand \(randomly choosing which card to pick\) or on any one card in play, at your choice. The same for Panic!, with the following differences: you can target only cards of a player at distance 1, and the card you choose goes in your hand even if it was already in play. When that card is in your hand, you can play it as any other card.

#### Cat Balou

> Force "any one player" to "discard a card", regardless of the distance

Can be used to discard any card in play. Dynamite, Jail, Barrel.
