## Work

### Window Management

* [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/)
  * This is the one I personally use
  * Cons:
    * Grid does not properly render on vertical oriented desktop
* [macOS native Split View](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204948)
* [Moom](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/moom/id419330170?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)

#### 3 Vertical Windows:

I like to split things into 3 windows.

* Central: main window of focus
* Left: Notes
* Right: Documentation

The center is my focus, left and right are supporting material.

Pros:

* Great for comparing two things, and keeping notes centered

Cons:

* Can be too tall

Options:

* 3x 24" 4K vertically oriented monitors
  * Breaks the limit of 1080px width
  * 24" when rotated
    * Height: 56cm
    * Width: 36cm

#### 2 Vertical Windows

I tried this, but I like having one main thing in front of me that I can focus on.

## 4K \(3840x2160\)

### 27"

I didn't like using 4K for my work \(programming, documents\).

Using at 4K:

* Fonts are too small for me
* I still reduce size to 2560x1440

MacBook allows me to push at:

* 1920x1080
* 2560x1440
* 3008x1692
* 3360x1890
* 3840x2160

#### Scaling to 3360x1890 @27"

* Feels like a lot happening at one time in a small space
* Feels very compressed.
* It's very tall, which can be useful.
* Fonts are small.
  * Feels like it can be very straining over long period of time.

| Resolution | 1/2 | 1/3 |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3360x1890 | 1680x1890 | 1120x1890 | 1/3 resolution is ok size |
| 3008x1692 | 1504x1692 | 1002x1682 | 1/3 resolution is awkward size |

### 34"

* [Dell U3219Q](https://www.dell.com/en-my/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-monitor-u3219q/apd/210-aqwp/monitors-monitor-accessories)

| Resolution | Pixel Per Inch | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3840x2160 | 140 |  |
| 3360x1890 | 122.5 |  |
|  | 110 | Ideal |
| 3008x1692 | 109 | But awkward 1/3 size |

### 35"

If I can find a 35" 4K monitor. Pixel Per Inch: 109. I can use the full 4K at a comfortable display.

Seems I can fit a lot of vertical ext as well `2160px` vs `1440px`.

## Reviews

### Dell U2717D: 2560x1440 @ 27"

Likes:

Panel Dimensions

* Height: 33.33cm
* Width: 60cm

### Dell P2715Q: 4K \(3840x2160\) @ 27"

Dislikes:

* Bezels are big
* Personal for me, I didn't use the 4k
* 4K @ 60hz on MacBook Pro 2017 15" does not work as expected
  * Requires a USB-C to DisplayPort cable
  * Dongles \(USB-HDMI\) do not work
    * Output at 30hz

### Dell U3419W: 3440x1440 @ 34"

Likes:

* USB-C charges my MacBook Pro 2017 15"
* You can push audio to the screen
  * Audio is controlled on screen

Dislikes:

* Bottom Bezel has this plastic strip coming out
* Wished the 2 usb ports on the side were on the back
* Screen audio quality is flat, and muffled
* It's a little "tight" when windows are vertically tiled for 3 windows at 1146px per window.
* I think it could it be taller, by an inch or two.
  * Add more vertical pixels.

Panel Dimensions

* Height: 33.33cm

### Pixel Pitch / Pixel Per Inch

This is my personal preference. I notice I like it when the Pixel per inch is 109 \(or a ratio of it\). Anything higher than that is too small for my eyes.

| Device | Pixel Per Inch | Pixel Pitch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MacBook Pro 2017 15" | 220 |  |
| Dell U2717D: 2560x1440 @ 27" | 109 | 0.233mm |
| Dell U3419W: 3440x1440 @ 34" | 109 | 0.233mm |
| Dell P2715Q: 4K \(3840x2160\) @ 27" | 163 | 0.1554mm |
| Dell U3219Q: 4K \(3840x2160\) @ 32" | 140 | 0.182mm |

### DisplayPort daisy-chaining \(multistream / MST\)
