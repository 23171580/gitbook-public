[Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) for window management on Mac.

* Cons:
  * Grid does not properly render on vertical oriented desktop

## Vertical Orientation

Problems:

* 27" displays are too tall
* 14" ideally
* Cannot use 1920x1080 displays, as 1080 for the width would be too small
* 2560x1440 displays, all come in 27" sizes
