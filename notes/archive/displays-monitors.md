Minimum width: 1280px

* Sites now are being unfriendly to smaller screens
* Or treat smaller screens as mobile devices

## Work

[Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) for window management on Mac.

* Cons:
  * Grid does not properly render on vertical oriented desktop

#### 3 Vertical Windows:

I like to split things into 3 windows.

* Central: main window of focus
* Left: Notes
* Right: Documentation

The center is my focus, left and right are supporting material.

Pros:

* Great for comparing two things, and keeping notes centered

#### 2 Vertical Windows

I tried this, but I like having one main thing in front of me that I can focus on.

## 4K \(3840x2160\) @ 27"

I didn't like using 4K for my work \(programming, documents\).

Using at 4K:

* Fonts are too small for me
* I still reduce size to 2560x1440

MacBook allows me to push at:

* 1920x1080
* 2560x1440
* 3008x1692
* 3360x1890
* 3840x2160

#### 3360x1890

* Feels like a lot happening at one time in a small space
* Feels very compressed.
* It's very tall, which can be useful.
* Fonts are small.
  * Feels like it can be very straining over long period of time.

| Resolution | 1/2 | 1/3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3360x1890 | 1680x1890 | 1120x1890 |

## UWQHD

Ultra Wide Quad High Definition: `3440x1440`

Displays:

* `1146x1440`: if dividing by 3
  * Cons: Doesn't hit 1280px minimum

Pros:

* Single cable; if going USB-C
* Can tile 3 windows vertically

Alternatives:

* Three vertically oriented displays
  * Pros:
    * Forces clear delineation between displays
  * Cons:
    * Bezels \(can get smaller displays\)
    * More cable/power management

## Vertical Orientation

Problems:

* 27" displays are too tall
* 14" ideally
* Cannot use 1920x1080 displays, as 1080 for the width would be too small
* 2560x1440 displays, all come in 27" sizes

## Other

Macs do not support DisplayPort daisy-chaining \(multitream / MST\)
