# Password Managers

I personally use [1Password](https://1password.com/).

Alternatives:

* [LassPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
* [DashLane](https://www.dashlane.com/)
* [Apple's iCloud KeyChain](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085)

#### 1Password

Can store other secure information \(Credit Card numbers, SSNs, WiFi Routers\).

Dislikes:

* Subscription Service

#### Apple's iCloud KeyChain

I dislike the desktop support. Only works in Safari. I only use it to store hotspot passwords.

#### Have I Been Pwned?

Test wether your data has been compromised, and sign up for alerts.
