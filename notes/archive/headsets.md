# Headsets

## AirPods

After 2 years they seem to be dying.

## Bose QuickComfort 35 \(version 1\)

* Still working great after 2 years
* I love the detachable and replaceable audio cable.
  * Incident of someone breaking my cable because it was plugged into the airplane seat and they crushed it when moving
* I love that the ear cuffs are also replaceable.
  * They got worn out after the first year, probably because of heavy use of it with my sunglasses during commuting

Cons:

* Micro USB

## Iâ€™m eyeing:

### Sony WH-1000XM3

Pros:

* USB -C
