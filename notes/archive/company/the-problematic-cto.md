# The Problematic CTO

## Attributes of the problematic CTO

* Toxic
* Holds the business and product hostage
* Bottleneck at the company
* People want to leave the company because of the CTO
* Not accountable to anyone
* Doesn’t respect non technical people
* “Know it alls”
  * Think they are the best
  * “One trick pony”
    * May not implement the best relevant tech
  * Challenges everyone
* Unpredictable
  * Delivery deadlines
  * Availability
* Poor understanding of product

### Personal Notes

What do I dislike about technical people:

* Over inflated egos
* They think they are the best
* They think they know it all
* They don’t consider weaknesses and problems in their designs
* They don’t see their faults
* They don’t see the faults of their thinking
* They have one tool, and only use it
* “When all you are given is a hammer, you see everything as a nail”
* Don’t consider hiring difficulties
* Tendency to use new tech, or architectures, makes it harder to hire
* Don’t mention migration strategies
* No consideration of MVP; or “lean startup”
* Tendency:
  * To glorify things
  * Rebuild the wheel
* Magpies; attracted to shiny new tech
* Don’t know how to build for long term, or longevity
* They are not product oriented

## Hopeful Goals

* CTO stays on
  * Maintain organizational and technical knowledge
* CTO learns growth mindset
* CTO becomes accountable
* Transfer of knowledge
* If CTO leaves, a transition plan is prepared

### Overall risks/concerns:

* CTO leaves
* Bad blood
* Nothing changes
* Things get worse

Mitigated by:

### Introduce Complementary Role \(CPO, VP of E\)

## Transition Plan

* Knowledge to be transferred

  * Architecture
  * Infrastructure

### Pre Kick Off

* Understand goals and expectations

* Identify tools, fires, glossary, org chart

### Questions to help me think about the transition process:

* How can we make this transition a success?
* What would cause this transition to fail?
* What is everyones expectations?
