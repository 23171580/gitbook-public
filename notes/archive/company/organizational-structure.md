## Conway's Law

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

From [Production-Ready Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053675.do):

> Conway's Law asserts that organizations are constrained to produce application designs which are copies of their communication structures. This often leads to unintended friction points. The 'Inverse Conway Maneuver' recommends evolving your team and organizational structure to promote your desired architecture. Ideally your technology architecture will display isomorphism with your business architecture.

### Inverse Conway's Law

From [Production-Ready Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053675.do):

> The inverse of Conway's Law \(which we'll call the Inverse Conway's Law\) is also valid and is especially relevant to the microservice ecosystem: the organization structure of a company is determined by the architecture of its product.
