## Public Transport

You don't need a local public transportation card.

Feel free to use:

* PayWave \(Mastercard or Visa\)
  * Just tap and go
* Apple Watch
  * Apple Pay needs to be enabled
  * Steps \(for entering and exiting\):
    * Double click the side button to activate "Apple Pay"
    * Tap your watch on the "card reader"
  * View transactions:
    * Go to the "Watch" App
    * Scroll to "Wallet & Apple Pay"
    * Click the card you use
    * Click "Transactions"
    * It took me about 12hrs for the transaction to appear 
* iPhone
  * Apple Pay needs to be enabled
  * It's easier if you enable "double click to pay"
  * Steps \(for entering and exiting\):
    * Double click the side button to activate "Apple Pay"
      * If this is not enabled, you need to open your "Wallet" app
        * This can be done from the "Control Center" or the App itself
    * Remember to authenticate with Face ID or Fingerprint reader
    * Tap your phone on the "card reader"

Notes:

I you get the TransitLink SimplyGo app you can see your transactions used on the MRT card or Credit Card \(need to add your card to the app before it can track\)
