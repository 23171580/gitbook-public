# Apple

I enjoy the Apple ecosystem for its integration. I won't say I'm an Apple enthusiast, but I really enjoy the integration across devices.

Pros:

* Copy/pasting works seamlessly across devices
  * Handover is nice
  * Airdrop is convenient
* Devices retains value
* Thieves nowadays are less inclined to steal Apple devices as they hard more difficult to unlock
* Apple Health integration

Cons:

* Apple ecosystem has gotten expensive
  * MacBook Pro 15": $1,999
  * Apple Watch Series 4: $399
  * iPhone X 256GB: $1149
  * iPad 2018 256GB: $949
  * Total: $4,496

## Buying a Device

* Check [MacRumor's Buyer's Guide](https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/) on when to best buy one
* Ideally soon after launch
  * Apple doesn't releases devices often, so this is the best way to maximize the value of the latest device
