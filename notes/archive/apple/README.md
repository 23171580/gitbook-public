# Apple

I've been using Apple devices since 2001, but I'm curious about exploring Windows for its Windows Subsystem for Linux \(WSL\) and how Satya Nadella is now leading the direction of Microsoft.

I enjoy the Apple ecosystem for its integration. I won't say I'm an Apple enthusiast, but I really enjoy the integration across devices.

Pros:

* Integration across devices
  * Easy to switch devices which your AirPods are connected to
  * Copy/pasting works seamlessly across devices
    * Handover is nice
    * Airdrop is convenient
* Devices retains value
* Thieves nowadays are less inclined to steal Apple devices as they hard more difficult to unlock
* Apple Health integration
* Tracking of devices
* Family support
  * Family sharing
    * Purchase Sharing
    * iCloud Storage
    * I don't use:
      * Apple Music
      * Location Sharing
      * Screen Time
* Seamless migration between devices
  * For example:
    * iPhone 6S to iPhone X
    * iPad Pro 2017" to iPad Pro 2018"
  * Support by iCloud

Cons:

* Apple ecosystem has gotten expensive
  * Devices
    * MacBook Pro 15": $1,999
    * Apple Watch Series 4: $399
    * iPhone X 256GB: $1149
    * iPad 2018 256GB: $949
    * AirPods: $159
    * Total: $4,655
  * Subscriptions
    * Apple Family: $2.99/month for 200GB
      * I personally think this is reasonable

Wants:

* Cheaper devices
* AirPower
* Apple Health app for iPad, and macOS
  * I want to be able to view my Apple Health information on my different devices
* MacBook Air 15"
