# Apple Notes

I use Apple Notes for quick note taking and brain dumping, but it's terrible for archiving. It's great for keeping things quickly in sync across Apple devices, and for short term notes.

When you have 1000+ notes, Apple Notes gets huge, messy and unwieldly.

I prefer to quickly jot with Apple Notes, but migrate the thoughts to Google Docs.

Pros:

* Pin notes

Cons:

* No nested folders
* Can get disorganized with large number of notes or folders
