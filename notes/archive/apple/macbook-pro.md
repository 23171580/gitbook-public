# MacBook Pro

## MacBook Pro 15" 2017

Note: This is the USB-C MacBook Pros

Pros:

* Lighter than the previous \(non USB-C\) builds
  * 500grams lighter
* "Universal" charger; via USB-C

Cons:

* Escape key is not a physical button \(uses TouchBar\)
  * I'm a VIM user, but I think a physical escape key would make a huge different even on other apps.

Notes:

* I don't mind USB-C
  * Personally, I don't use accessories much
  * So I enjoy the weight savings

## MacBook Air 15"

I want a MacBook Air 15".

* I like the bigger screen of the MacBook Pro 15"
* I like the weight/size of the MacBook Air
