# iPad Pro 11" 2018

My main note taking device. For anything serious, I go to my MacBook Pro 15", for its larger screen, and mouse support.

What I like about a tablet/iPad:

* Can casually bring to meetings
  * Less serious than a laptop
* Because I can do less on the iPad, it forces me to focus
* The lack of good multi-tasking is a positive for me. I get less distracted.

Wants:

* Apple Health app for iPad
  * I want to be able to view my Apple Health information on my iPad

### iPad Pro 11" 2018 vs iPad Pro 10.9" 2017

Overall: It's still an iPad

Pro:

* I like the USB-C, "universal" charger everywhere
* Larger screen
* Apple case protects the full iPad

### iPad Pro 12.9" 2017

I used to own the larger iPad Pro 12.9" 2017 model. It's big. It feels like a great laptop replacement, but it's big and not entirely practical to carry around with me everywhere, hence why I like the smaller model.
