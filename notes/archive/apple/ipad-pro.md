# iPad Pro 11" 2018

My main note taking device. For anything serious, I go to my MacBook Pro 15", for its larger screen, and mouse support.

Wants:

* Apple Health app for iPad
  * I want to be able to view my Apple Health information on my iPad

#### iPad Pro 11" 2018 vs iPad Pro 10.9" 2016

Overall: It's still an iPad

Pro:

* I like the USB-C, "universal" charger everywhere
* Larger screen
* Apple case protects the full iPad
