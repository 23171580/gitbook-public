# Remote Calls

Now that we are all WFH, some remote video meetings tips

* Try to use a microphone
* Turn on your webcam
  * Let's be comfortable with everyone in their home clothes and no makeup. No judgement here~
* Check your microphone source is correct
  * Mine sometimes messes up when I connect/disconnect to my webcam/mic
* Join meetings a bit early \(mute your audio/video, lower your volume\) so that you don't miss a meeting.
  * Also drop the URL in a slack channel so that other people can easily join
  * Ask people to join early as well, so that you can socialize as well
* In a meeting, and no one there? When pinging people, drop the URL in the message
* Have a recurring meeting? Use a slackbot reminder to send the meeting URL early to a meeting
  * For example, meeting is at 11am, set a slackbot reminder to go at 10.55am

```text
/remind #channel "Standup $URL" at 10.55am every Monday
```

* Can't hear someone? Try to use visual cues to get their attention \(thumbs up/ thumbs down\)

Any other tips/suggestions I missed out?
