# Cardio

## Non Stationary

## Stationary

Pros:

* Great opportunity to catch up on [Podcasts](../podcasts.md)

Cons:

* Can get boring as hell

### Elliptical

Properties:

* You can go at your own speed, if you need to gradual slow down \(or speed up\) its easier
* Easier on the knees

### Treadmill

Properties:

* You have to go at the speed of the treadmill
  * Yes you can change the speed, but requires you to push the button
  * For better, allows you to test yourself going at a consistent speed
