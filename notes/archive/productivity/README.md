## Note Taking

See [Note Taking](note-taking.md) for more details

* [Apple Notes](../apple/apple-notes.md)
* Deep Thought
* GitBook
* Google Docs
* Notational Velocity

Apple notes for quick short form writing that I may want to sync across my Apple devices. Terrible for archiving or long term notes.

Google Docs for long term note taking. Used in combination with my [Timestamps](https://timestamps.aizatto.com/) tool.

GitBook for summarized notes and quick public references I want to share with other people.

Deep Thought for my contemplations.

I've been using Notational Velocity less and less.

I have my own ideas for a note taking app.

### Asana

I currently use Asana, and set recurring monthly, quarterly, or yearly tasks. I use it as a reminder system as well.
