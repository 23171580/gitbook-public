# Note Taking

Note taking serves a different purpose than writing documents. This is just to jot down information.

Also see [Productivity](./)

## What I Wish For:

* Tags / Taxonomy
* Automatic Entering of Timestamps

## Requirements for Note Taking

* Has to handle a lot of notes, think 1000s of notes
* Decent styling

## Apple Notes

Used for:

* Basic note taking.
* Short term notes.

Pros:

* Sync across Apple devices

Cons:

* Doesn't scale when you have 1000s of notes

## Evernote

Feels clumsy

## Google Docs

I use this with my [Timestamps ](https://timestamps.aizatto.com/)tool.

Method of use:

* Single document per topic
* Timestamp the time of entering note

Used for:

* Notes I know I want to keep long term/archive

## nvAlt / Notational Velocity

This used to be my power horse, but I've stopped using it once syncing with other products worked decently.
