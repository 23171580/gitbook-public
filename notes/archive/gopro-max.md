# GoPro MAX

I got the GoPro MAX as my introduction into 360 cameras.

It does something my iPhone/handphone camera can't. Take 360 photos/videos, and so I felt that gave me something new that I previously never really had.

Cons:

* iPad App doesn't do vertical/landscape orientation well
  * Sometimes it goes vertical, when I want landscape
