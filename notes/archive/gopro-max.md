# GoPro MAX

I got the GoPro MAX as my introduction into 360 cameras.

It does something my iPhone/handphone camera can't. Take 360 photos/videos, and so I felt that gave me something new that I previously never really had.

Cons:

* Remember to rest camera on its side
* iOS issues:
  * iOS doesn't support saving 360 photos/videos to the native Photos app
  * iPad App doesn't do vertical/landscape orientation well
    * Sometimes it goes vertical, when I want landscape
* Facebook issues:
  * Cannot upload 360 from iOS
    * Works ok when uploading file from Desktop
  * PowerPano upload doesn't view in Pano
    * Doesn't work on iOS or Desktop 
* Google Photos:
  * Doesn't handle 360 files

  * Doesn't properly Power Pano either
