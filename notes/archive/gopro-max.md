# GoPro MAX

I got the GoPro MAX as my introduction into 360 cameras.

It does something my iPhone/handphone camera can't. Take 360 photos/videos, and so I felt that gave me something new that I previously never really had.

Pros:

* No need to worry about:
  * framing
  * stabilization
  * horizontal leveling

Cons:

* No remote, have to use voice commands
* Remember to rest camera on its side
* iOS issues:
  * iOS doesn't support saving 360 photos/videos to the native Photos app
  * iPadOS
    *  doesn't do vertical/landscape orientation well
      * Sometimes it goes vertical, when I want landscape
  * Wish you can speed up or slow down a video
  * YouTube 90 second limit when exporting from the iOS/iPadOS app 
    * Workaround: AirDrop the file to your macOS, this will export it into an mp4 file.
    * Upload the mp4 file
  * Cannot stitch videos on iOS/iPadOS
    * Sucks when TimeWarp splits videos at 6m40sec 
* Facebook issues:
  * Cannot upload 360 from iOS
    * Works ok when uploading file from Desktop
  * PowerPano upload doesn't view in Pano
    * Doesn't work on iOS or Desktop 
* Instagram:
  * No support for 360 photos or videos
* Google Photos:
  * Doesn't handle 360 photo files

  * Doesn't properly Power Pano either
* YouTube
  * Doesn't natively support the .360 video files
  * Have to export to .mp4 and then upload
  * YouTube compression doesn't seem that good, will have to experiment
  * 90 second limit when exporting from the iOS/iPadOS app
* Memory Card
  * You need to take battery out to take the memory card out
  * May consider putting a tape on the memory card so I can yank it out

    * This will at least include sound
