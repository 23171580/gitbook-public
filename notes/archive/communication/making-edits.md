# Making Edits

For minor \(easily revertable\) edits, I think it's ok to make the edits inline.

## Larger Edits

For larger edits, before making an edit, ask the owner if you can. Larger edits are harder to revert \(even with history\). 

State what you'd like to change.

Sometimes it's easier to make a copy of the original, and then edit.
