# Blockchain

## **Use cases**

* Event tracking

## **Different implementations:**

* Proof of work
* Proof of state

## Concerns:

* No customer service
* Losing private key
* Linking transactions
* Not instantaneous
* Writes Transaction speed
* Data that is stored off the chain
  * If so few things are on chain, why even have blockchain.
* Size of the chain
* Benefits of blockchain requires decentralization. In order for decentralization, other people need to be incentivized for hosting.
  * I don't think people would be incentivized to host.
* Scaling challenges of blockchain
  * transactions per second
  * size of the chain \(in Gigabytes\)
* Introduces complexity without reducing it

| Chain | Transactions per Second | Size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bitcoin | 7 tx/s | 197 GB \(Jan 2019\) |
| Etherium | 25 tx/s | 670 GB \(Jan 2019\) |
| Ripple | 40,000 tx/s |  |

## **Thoughts:**

Block chain is a distributed social enterprise .

Block chain is about people wanting control. But they donâ€™t realize how much control they have let go.

Individual vs group.

Requires good actors in all environment factors.

Blockchain is not used in the porn industry.

### Implementing Blockchain

Requires you to think of:

* what is on chain, and what is off chain

### Questions:

What can you prototype faster with blockchain?
