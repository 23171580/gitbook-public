This is a public braindump of all my thoughts.

Every page here is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) \(see my [commit history](https://github.com/aizatto/gitbook-public/commits/master)\) and is not written in stone. Expect content to be updated based on any learnings or life experiences that I may go through.
