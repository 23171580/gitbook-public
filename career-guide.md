### Evaluating Companies

How much risk are you willing to take?

## General Job Application Process

The goal should ideally be, to do the least amount of work to get into the company you want to get in to.

If you don't know what company you want to join, this will increase the number of companies you are going to talk to. This can help you focus on what you want.

The general application process is like so:

1. General Call with Recruiter
2. Technical Phone Screen or Homework Assignment
3. Onsite
4. Offer extended

Knowing this process, the goal should be how many offers do we want to evaluate and we should work backwards, because this a time consuming process.

1. Offer extended
2. Onsite
3. Technical Phone Screen or Homework Assignment
4. General Call with Recruiter

### Example

If we want 3 offers, how many onsites do we need? Minimum: 3 \(Best case scenario\) Probably: 6

If we want 6 onsites, how many technical phone screens do we need? Minimum: 6 \(Best case scenario\) Probably: 12

If we want 12 technical phone screens, how many recruiters do we need? Minimum: 12 \(Best case scenario\) Probably: 15

We look at the process, work in reverse, and figure out how many offers we want.

Talking to 15 recruiters, is exhausting.

### Spreadsheets

Use a spreadsheet to manage all the companies you are talking to, and follow up steps.

Reserve a column for:

* Glassdoor Rating
* Glassdoor Salary Range
* Paysa Salary Range

### Scheduling

If we have to take at least 6 onsites, how many can we do a week? Probably: 2

If we an take 2 onsites. This means that the process will take at least 3 weeks to a month.

### Setting up meetings

Becareful about scheduling meetings/onsites back to back because they may stretch longer than the given time. They can also be very exhausting.

I use [vyte.in](https://www.vyte.in) to coordinate with recruiters about time availability.

### General Call with Recruiter

* Lasts from 15mins to 30mins. Some can last longer.

### Technical Phone Screen or Homework Assignment

* The phone screen lasts up to an hour.
* Homework assignments lasts up to two hours.

### Onsites

* These last the whole day. From 4 to 6 hours.
* Arrive early.
* Mentally taxing.
* Bring your own whiteboard markers and erasers. Theirs may suck.

Be prepared for:

* Systems Designs
* Product Design Questions
* Be careful about scheduling onsites back to back. Due to how taxing it is this can be really tiring.

#### Pair Programming

* Work with the interviewer 
* Check your data structures

#### Whiteboarding

* Not the best.
* Highly subjective.
* How precise a code do you want?
* Not the best environment available.

Whiteboard sucks:

* [https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/blob/master/README.md)

## After Joining / Accepting / Acceptance

* [https://notes.breakoutlist.com/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-working-at-a-startup-5e29b8f5f7a1](https://notes.breakoutlist.com/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-working-at-a-startup-5e29b8f5f7a1)
* Define your expectations for joining the company.
* Ask how you can be able to do your best?
* How can I set myself up for success?
* What expectations does your manager have?
* It takes about 3 weeks to normalize.

## Market Rates

* [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com/)
* [Paysa](https://www.paysa.com/salary-rank)

## Rejection

* Always ask for feedback.
* If you really like the company, ask how you could work together.

## Coding

Example Question:

* Make assumptions
* If they tell you are taking input from STDIN, start by just taking input from a string.
* Write example cases as comments, or part of the code execution. This gives discussion points.
* Explain assumptions about validity of input
* Create an `assert` function, which takes in the `expected` result given an `input`. See [PHP](/php#simple-assert) or [JS](/js#simple-assert)

```javascript
input = "a b c d e";

main(input) {
  ...
}

assert(expected, input) {
  console.log(input);
  actual = main(input);
  result = expected === actual;
  console.log(result);
  if (!result) {
    console.log(actual);
    console.log(expected);
  }
}

// Case 1
assert(expected, input);

// Case 2
assert(expected2, input2);

// Case 3
assert(expected3, input3);
```

## FAQ

### It is ok to decline a recruiter

It is ok to decline a recruiter. You can't take all opportunities, and are going to have to decide which one to take.

There will always be opportunities, as long as you keep working on yourself.

* Thank them for their time.
* Leave it open, that this opportunity doesn't interest you right now, and that you might reach out ot them in the future.

## Interviews suck

* The system is a black box. You generally can't give feedback to your recruiter. It's great if a recruiter allows you to.
* You are the mercy of your interviewer. If your interviewer sucks. So will your interview.
* Some interviewers will be purposely vague, hoping you would ask to clarify. This is a pain in the ass.
* CS questions suck. They don't directly represent what you may be doing on a day to day basis.
* Did you get hired for a niche? If you aren't familiar with your niche, this could ruin your experience. \(Front End Engineer vs Back End Engineer\)
