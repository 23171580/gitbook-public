# Why GitBook?

Requirements:

* Easy maintenance
* Git/file system support
  * Allows for easy migration
  * Doesn't require me to have internet access
  * I can easily do a `grep` or `ack` locally to find information.
  * In theory, easy migration to different platforms
* Markdown support
  * Easy styling
* Static

Pros:

* Nice UI
* Decent free Basic plan
  * Includes one free private book
* No need to always use command line
* Works well on iPad through Safari
* Custom domains
* Google Analytics support
* Syncs with GitHub

Limitations:

* Single theme
  * I don't really mind it. It's a decent but most importantly, usable theme.
* Logs to git commit history could be nicer
